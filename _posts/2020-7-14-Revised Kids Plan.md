title: Revised Kids Plan!
---


**Coding is a language that let's you speak to computers, the next human!!**

You know what, with the advancement in tech, we either become the consumer or the producer. Consuming content makes you satisfied but making and creating new things gives the satisfaction of being a god. Seriously, when I code, I feel as if I am making something and bringing it to life.

Human beings have craved for creation and that's why we adore paintings, sculptors and big monuments but that is the fact of history. Why have we never heard of any inventor after Thomas, yeah that same guy who invented light bulb. You know why, because there are many who have brought smartphones to our hands, GPU in our home and personalized alexa near our bed. 

Let's see a dream, indeed a reality. Education is not about information or accumulating knowledge but about grasping and implementing that. Coding cool things gives you that fun and feeling of being a god where you are actually making things, breaking things and using your brain.

Have you read Sapiens, that famous book where Harari talks about how the next decade is going to be the time of super humans. I also want to be one but how?

But let's come back to why get into coding at young age?

* Is it to impress that aunty living in US or for that neighbor kid whose dad is software developer? No.
* Is it to become Zuckerberg to build multi-billion dollar startup? No.
* Is it to break the monotony of the current syllabus in school? No.
* Is it to sound cool infront of friends? A big No.

We should learn to code because we want to improve our brain, its facets of problem solving and for the fun of making things.

This program of 70 days needs lots of effort and consistency to make you confident. We believe and expect you to be honest in your hardwork and leave the planning part for us.

**But Why to start? Tell me that Ankit!!**

**Why?**

*   We really encourage children to learn due to the minimal and easy to read style of Python.
*   By experimenting, children learn and strengthen their brains. Even when they make a mistake they learn. Children can be creative and creativity is encouraged. Creativity is part of the process and not always the product.
*   Coding helps children to be able to  visualize abstract concepts, lets them apply math to real-world situations, and makes math fun and creative.  Coding is present in many of today’s STEM programs.
*   As they learn to code and give direction they learn that there is no one way to do something and that even if their way didn’t work.  They can improve upon what they have already done without worrying about failing. Coding is a basic literacy in the digital age, and it is important for kids to understand and be able to work with and understand the technology around them.

**But Ankit, you have such an amazing CV and have lot of dreams, why do you teach kids?**

True, If it is possible, I would like to learn how to code from Bill than any primary teacher who teaches just because of sustaining himself/herself. For me, teaching is my passion. I like being with kids and young mind to understand how brain works. When I was kid, I never looked into my own thinking pattern but by helping others and solving their difficulty, I find it fascinating how kids are learning without baggage of what is next in life!!

You can read about my abroad work experience, offshore project with startup in Texas, visiting new countries, working with foreigners, speaking new language and much more by reading my premium blogs where I have shared all the ways.

**But how are your sessions designed and how is it different? **

I don't teach, I inspire. That's an one line answer. I don't believe in notes, neither in working hard. If you enjoy the process, you will not feel you are working hard but your parents will see you doing so. 
If you feel you are working hard, it's time to move on to the next wonderful thing. One life, many dreams so why waste time in things which you don't like!

**Will my kid enjoy the process?**

I'm not an astrologer, I'm an engineer. I love maths and programming. I know not everyone does but having an expert talk a bit about his wonderful experience can certainly ignite the young minds. As my inspiration Kalam said, "As a child of God, I am greater than anything that can happen to me.". So, let's do shree ganesh without many doubts. Anyway the most precious thing is your and mine time. So, let's not miss the bus.
